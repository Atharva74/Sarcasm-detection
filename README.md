A Sarcasm Detection System is a computational model designed to identify sarcastic statements in text or speech. The system typically employs natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the linguistic features and contextual cues of the input text or speech and classify it as either sarcastic or not. Some common features used by such systems include the use of exaggerated or contradictory language, irony, and sentiment polarity. The development of effective sarcasm detection systems has significant applications in fields such as social media analysis, customer service, and sentiment analysis.During the past few years, there has been a lot of increase  in  opinionated  textual  data  in  social  media over the Internet. Sentiment Analysis is used to analyze the opinionated  text.It  helps us  to  understand (text)  the emotion behind the writer. It is facing many challenges and Sarcasm detection is one of the major challenges in it. Sarcasm  is the  unconventional  way  of conveying  a message  which  conflicts with the context.It can  lead to  a state  of  ambiguity.The motivation for developing a sarcasm detection system lies in the need to improve the accuracy of natural language processing and sentiment analysis applications.
In this we have use news headlines dataset and in that first we have done data preprocessing.In data preprocessing it includes like loading dataset into pandas dataframe and various data cleaning techniques such as removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and removing stop words were applied to the text data. The preprocessed dataset was then used for training the machine learning model.The pre-trained GloVe word embeddings were used to represent words as dense vectors. The word embeddings were loaded into the system, and each word in the preprocessed dataset was replaced with its corresponding word vector. This resulted in a numerical representation of the text data that could be used as input to the machine learning model.Several classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest were experimented with, and the best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.The trained machine learning model was integrated into the Django web application. The user input from the web interface was processed, and the text data was preprocessed and fed into the trained model for sarcasm detection. The output of the model was then rendered on the web page to display the sarcasm detection results to the user.
